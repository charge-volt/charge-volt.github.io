## User Role Management

### Understanding Roles

**Administrator Role:**

- Can create and manage own content
- Can participate in projects and collaborations
- Cannot manage other users or system settings

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find a specific user | • Use the search function<br/>• Check spelling of email addresses<br/>• Verify the user is actually registered |
| User says they didn't receive invitation email | • Check spam folders<br/>• Verify email address spelling<br/>• Resend invitation if necessary |
| Changes to user information aren't saving | • Ensure you clicked the save button<br/>• Check for error messages<br/>• Verify admin permissions |
| User can't access platform after role change | • Role changes may require user to log out and log back in<br/>• Verify role assignment is correct |
| Accidentally deleted a user | • User deletion is permanent, you will need to re-invite the user
