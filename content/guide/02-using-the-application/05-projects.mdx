## Introduction

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- Create and organize research projects with multiple resources
- Set up collaborative projects with multiple creators
- Navigate project folders and manage content organization
- Understand project permissions and access control
- Add resources and create folder structures within projects

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Logged in to your account](content/guide/01-getting-started/02-login)
- [Understood how to add content](/content/guide/02-using-the-application/03-new)
- [Familiarized yourself with tags](/content/guide/02-using-the-application/03-tags)

## Overview

Projects are specialized knowledge bases that allow you to organize multiple resources around specific research topics or initiatives. Think of them as focused collections that bring together related documents, creating a streamlined workspace for particular areas of study or collaboration.

## Understanding Projects

### What Projects Are

- **Focused collections** of related resources and documents
- **Collaborative workspaces** with multiple creators and contributors
- **Organized structures** using folders and subfolders
- **Research-oriented** environments for specific topics or initiatives

### Key Features

- **Resource organization** - Group related documents together
- **Folder structures** - Create hierarchical organization within projects
- **Collaborative access** - Multiple creators can contribute and manage content
- **Metadata integration** - Resources maintain full metadata access
- **Easy navigation** - Intuitive browsing between projects and folders

## Projects Page Overview

### Browsing Projects

The projects page works similarly to other sections:

- **Search functionality** - Find projects using standard search queries
- **Project listings** - View all available projects with basic information
- **Universal access** - All users can view and access any project

### Project Information Display

Each project shows:

- **Project name** - Clear identifier for the research focus
- **Creator information** - Who established and manages the project
- **Tag associations** - Topic classifications for easy discovery
- **Access status** - Your permission level within the project

## Creating New Projects

### Basic Project Setup

- **Click "New Project"** or similar creation button
- **Enter project name** - Choose a descriptive, research-focused title
- **Add description (optional)** - Explain the project's purpose and scope
- **Select relevant tags (optional)** - Help others discover your project
- **Add co-creators (optional)** - Invite collaborators to help manage the project

### Project Planning Tips

**Choose names that are:**

- Descriptive of the research focus
- Specific enough to distinguish from other projects
- Professional and clear to collaborators

**Consider adding:**

- Clear project descriptions explaining goals
- Relevant tags that match your research area
- Key collaborators who will contribute to the project

## Editing Existing Projects

### How to Edit a Project

- **Navigate to your project** - Find it in your project list or search
- **Click the {<EditIcon className="w-5 h-5 inline align-text-bottom" fill="#777" />} icon**
- **Update project details** - Modify name, description, tags, or collaborators
- **Save changes** - Don't forget to save your updates

### What You Can Edit

**Project information:**
- Project name and description
- Folder name
- Tags

**Team management:**
- Add co-creators

## Understanding Project Permissions

Projects use a **Modified Discretionary Access Control** system with clear permission levels:

### Permission Hierarchy

**Administrators**

- Can alter anything in any project
- Full system-wide management capabilities

**Project Creators**

- Can manage the entire project and all its contents
- Can alter or delete any resource or folder within their project
- Can update project metadata (title, description, tags)
- Can add additional creators (but cannot remove existing ones)

**Folder Creators**

- Can manage only their specific folder and its contents
- Cannot alter items outside their folder
- Can add, remove, and organize content within their folder

**All Users**

- Can view and access any project
- Can add resources to projects (with appropriate permissions)
- Cannot delete or alter existing content unless they created it

<Callout title="Creator Permissions">
Project creators can only be added, never removed. This ensures project continuity and prevents accidental loss of management access.
</Callout>

## Navigating Within Projects

### Project Structure

When you enter a project, you'll see:

- **Project metadata** - Creators and tags displayed at the top
- **Folder and resource listing** - Organized by type (folders first)
- **Navigation breadcrumbs** - Show your current location path
- **Sorting options** - Use ag-grid functionality to sort by any attribute

![Inside project](/images/guides/project-inside.png)

- Returns you to the parent folder or project root
- Simple one-level-up navigation

**Projects Button**

- Located at the top of the screen
- Takes you back to the main projects page
- Always available for quick exit from any project

### Content Organization

- **Folders appear first** - Easier to navigate hierarchical structure (can be changed by sorting on name)
- **Resources listed below** - Documents and files within the current folder
- **No pagination within folders** - All items visible for easier browsing
- **Sortable columns** - Click any column header to sort content

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't add resources to a project | • Check if you have permission for that folder<br/>• Contact the project or folder creator |
| Can't find a specific project | • Use the search function<br/>• Check if the project exists and you have access |
| Lost in project navigation | • Use breadcrumb navigation to jump back to higher levels<br/>• Use the "Projects" button to return to main page |
| Can't remove a resource from a project | • Only the person who added the resource or the folder/project creator can remove links |
| Cannot modify project metadata | • Only project creators can update title, description, tags, and creators |
