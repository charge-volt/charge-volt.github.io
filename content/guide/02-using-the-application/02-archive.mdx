## Overview

The Archive is a comprehensive document repository where you can browse, search, and access all the stored files. It features two distinct viewing modes and powerful AI-powered search capabilities.

## View Modes

The archive offers two different ways to view your documents:

### Table View (File Explorer Style)

Table view provides a structured, file explorer-like layout, perfect for browsing large collections of documents.

**Features of Table view:**

- **Name column** - Shows document titles and file names
- **Publication Date column** - Shows when documents were created or published
- **Icon** - Shows the file type

**Best for:**

- Browsing through many documents
- Getting an overview of the document collection

### List View (Search Engine Style)

List view provides detailed previews and content summaries, similar to search engine results.

**Features of List view:**

- **Document previews** - See content snippets from each document
- **Expandable details** - Click "more" to see additional content

**Best for:**

- Understanding document content at a glance
- Finding documents based on content, rather than just title or description
- Getting detailed previews before opening documents

### Switching Between Views

Use the view toggle buttons in the top-right corner:

- **Table button** - Switch to structured table layout
- **List button** - Switch to detailed preview layout

## AI-Powered Search

The Archive features intelligent search capabilities that understand context and content.

### Using the Seach Bar

1. Click in the search bar at the top of the page
2. Type your search query (keywords, phrases, or questions)
3. If necessary, you can filter by clicking on the {<Filter className="w-5 h-5 inline align-text-bottom" fill="#777" />} button
4. The AI will search through document content, not just titles
5. Results appear automatically as you type, sorted by relevance

### Search Capabilities

The AI search can find documents based on:

- **Keywords** - Direct word matches in documents
- **Concepts** - Related ideas and topics
- **Questions** - Natural language queries like "What is Charge"
- **Phrases** - Specific text passages
- **Context** - Understanding what you're looking for conceptually

<Callout title="AI Search Tip">
Try searching with natural questions like "what is charge" or "documents about citizen participation" - the AI understands context and concepts, not just exact word matches.
</Callout>

## Navigation and Pagination

### Moving Through Results

- **Previous/Next buttons** - Navigate between pages of results
- **Page indicator** - Shows current page (e.g., "5 / 5" or "1 / 1")

### Clearing Search

- **X button** - Click the X in the search bar to clear your search and return to all documents
- **Empty search** - Delete all text from search bar to see all files

### Accessing Documents

- Click on any document name to open the [right sidebar](/content/guide/03-components/02-right-sidebar.mdx)
- From there, you see all the associated metadata. You can also download the file, which will open a new tab

## Best Practices

### Effective Searching

1. **Start broad** - Use general terms first, then refine
2. **Use natural language** - Ask questions like you would to a person
3. **Try different approaches** - Search by topic, author, or content type
4. **Check both views** - Table for browsing, List for content-based searching

### Organizing Your Workflow

1. **Use Table view** for general browsing and date-based searches
2. **Use List view** when you know the content you're looking for
3. **Combine search with views** - Search first, then switch views for different perspectives
4. **Save time** with AI search instead of manual scrolling

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find a document you know exists | • Try different search terms or phrases<br/>• Switch between Table and List views<br/>• Check the filters<br/>• Use broader search terms first |
