**Author:** Elia Jabbour


Website documentation is built using MDX, which combines the power of Markdown with JSX components. This structure allows you to create rich, interactive documentation for both developers and end users.


## Documentation Structure
The documentation is organized in the `website/content` folder, which contains two primary directories:
- `docs`: Technical documentation intended for developers.
- `guide`: User guides and tutorials intended for end users


import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

<Files>
  <Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
        <File name="index.mdx" />
        <File name="file-1.mdx" />
        <File name="file-2.mdx" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="guide" defaultOpen>
        <File name="index.mdx" />
        <File name="file-1.mdx" />
        <File name="file-2.mdx" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
 </Files>

## Creating New Documentation
1. Choose the appropriate directory (`docs` or `guide`) 
2. Create a .mdx file with a descriptive name using kebab-case (e.g., api-authentication.mdx)
3. Add frontmatter to the file with a title and description see [MDX File Structure](#mdx-file-structure)
4. Write the content using Markdown and JSX components.
4. The system will automatically generate the pages and sidebar navigation based on the file structure.


## Creating Navigation Groups
By default, the sidebar displays a flat list of all documentation files in the `docs` and `guides` directories. To create dropdown (nested) sections in the sidebar, simply nest your MDX files within folders. Each folder will be rendered as a collapsible group, providing a more organized navigation experience.

Example:

1. Create a folder within docs or guides (e.g., docs/authentication/)
2. Add an optional index.mdx file in the folder, which will serve as the main page for the group.
3. Add additional .mdx files for subtopics.

<Files>
  <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="authentication" defaultOpen>
        <File name="index.mdx" />
        <File name="oauth.mdx" />
        <File name="api-keys.mdx" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
 </Files>

This will display as a dropdown labeled "Authentication" in the sidebar.

## MDX File Structure
Each MDX file should begin with frontmatter to define metadata here is an example:

```md
---
title: "Authentication"
description: "Learn how to authenticate with our API"
---

## Introduction

Content goes here...
```

## Adding Author Information
To maintain clear ownership and attribution, please add your name to the top of any documentation you create or significantly modify. This helps the team track contributions and know who to contact for questions about specific documentation.

Example:
```md
---
title: "Authentication"
description: "Learn how to authenticate with our API"
---

**Author:** Name1

## Introduction

Content goes here...
```
For documentation with multiple contributors, list all authors:

```md
**Authors:** Name1, Name2, Name3
```


## Writing Content

### Basic Markdown
MDX supports standard Markdown syntax:

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

- List item
- List item

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

1. Numbered list item
2. Numbered list item

> Blockquote

[Link text](https://example.com)

![Image alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)

`Inline code` and code blocks using triple backticks.
```

### Using Components
You can import and use React components in MDX:

```jsx
<Callout title="Title">Hello World</Callout>
```
The code above will render a callout component with the title "Title" and the text "Hello World" like this:

<Callout title="Title">Hello World</Callout>


## Notes:
- Do not modify the `(api)` folder, as it contains the API reference documentation generated by Swagger.
- The system will automatically generate table of contents for each page based on the headings in the content.
- The sidebar navigation is generated based on the file structure, so be sure to organize your files and folders accordingly.
- The system generates a unique `id` for each heading in the content, which can be used to create deep links to specific sections. For example, the heading `## Authentication` will have an `id` of `authentication`, which can be linked to using `#authentication`.
- Avoid using `#` (Heading 1) tags in the content, as they are reserved for the page title. Using multiple `<h1>` tags on a single page is not recommended.
